# loc_prep

A tool written in Python to prepare a Pro Tools session for videogame localization recordings. 

## Quickstart

1. On ` ~./Documents/Session prep/` create:

- A .csv file named _Tracker_filtered.csv_ with the lines to be recorded.
- A folder named _Audio files_ with all the waveform files correctly labeled.
- A _Beep.wav_ file (reference tone).

2. `run main.py file`
